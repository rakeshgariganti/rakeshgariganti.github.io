<h4>Project Rashmi-August 25, 2013</h4>
<p>
A small village in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh electricity is like a distant dream for the
inhabitants. We inquired about the problems faced by the villagers on a daily basis.
On interviewing some of them, one of the problems was considered and then
concluded that they pay Rs. 5 every alternate day to charge their mobile phones. At
times they wait for hours for their turn. The monthly cost of charging their mobile
phones approximates around Rs. 100 – 120. To address this problem, we have come
up with Project RASHMI, which aims to provide solar mobile phone chargers to the
villagers. The advantage being the phone is charged during the day without paying
any rent to the owner of the station and also the long queues would be rejected .Every
villager would have their personal charging station with them. The monthly
expenditure would drop to Rs. 19 for mobile phone charging.

<h4>Pilot Project 1 - First Milestone August 12, 2013</h4>
Today we reached a milestone in providing green and free electricity to the world.
Ten families living in dark for ages experienced the coolness of the fan and
brightness in the dark. We have installed small solar setups to 10 poor families in
village Bhajju, Shamli district and village Kamhera, Muzzafarnagar district of Uttar
Pradesh free of cost.

<div id="pilotmore" style="display:none;">
<p>
A PIR based motion sensor device which detects the motion of body heat and allows
the device to turn ON/OFF accordingly. Once the motion is detected, the appliance is
turned ON for an adjustable delay time. If the motion is continued to be detected, the
delay time extends.
