<h2>What We Do!!</h2>
<p>
We aim to provide solar charging stations, water pumping plants and food
preservation and cooling systems in villages which are unable to access the
conventional source of electricity and possess no such facilities. Also, small
products like solar home lighting systems, portable mobile phone chargers and
solar street lights are part of this initiative. <br><br>

‘free Spirits’ is an initiative to a greener world. Powering homes is not the only motive, but empowering people
with skills and knowledge to operate integrates our vision. This will ensure the
use of products efficiently and will ensure employment opportunities. The
products and the journey so far corroborate the aim to innovate products that
will save money and preserve the conventional sources of energy.
</p>
<p><h3>1. Introduction</h3>
The use of direct solar energy in India has evolved for more than three thousand years. Most
prominent of these are the drying of foods for preservation and assured availability during non-
crop periods of the year, the drying of garments/clothes, and therapeutic protocols for human
and animal health. This direct use of solar energy continues while modern technologies have
made the rural life dramatically different. The main sources of energy for rural communities of
India are electricity, gas, and petroleum. With increasing population, henceforth, increasing
need of energy, the present sources are unable to satisfy this rise in demand.
</p>
<p>
 In addition to this, burning of wood, charcoal, and other materials have negative environmental
consequences. For these reasons a paradigm shift is needed and that calls for extensive use of
non conventional sources of energy (solar, wind, biomass etc). India is a developing country,
and its economy is largely dependent on agriculture. But, in this era of modernization rural
India has been completely neglected. Therefore, targeting the agriculture sector of India for the
innovative use of solar power will directly contribute to the economy and development of the
nation. The intelligent and innovative uses of solar energy will render cost effective, reliable,
and environmentally friendly solutions for rural India.
</p>
<p>
<h3>2. The Technological Challenges</h3>
The main challenge we see for the solar power utilization in rural India is to maintain the values
and culture of the farm communities while providing solar based technology to exponentially
enhance the quality of life of the inhabitants. This requires a deliberate understanding of the
needs of rural inhabitants and innovative approach for implementing and integrating solar
power in their life style.
</p>
<p>
Cost is a major concern for rural India. Rural inhabitants tend to be very cost conscientious and
most often do not have the monetary resources needed for high-tech solutions. They tend to
do mental trade-offs on a daily basis to economize and use their resources most effectively.
Borrowing is not a welcome practice in these communities. In view of this, any solar
technological solutions have to be cost-effective.
</p>
<p>
The challenge is to develop devices and appliances for rural applications that can stand rough
use by persons not technologically savvy. For this reason, technologies have to be rugged,
reliable, and easy to use and repair. The ease of maintenance is essential for successful
technology intervention. Furthermore, costs associated with repair and maintenance should be
minimal. Weather changes have dramatic effect on the amount of solar energy that can be
harvested. For this reason, technological approaches should work in cloudy, rainy, and winter
weather because the farm work continues in all seasons.
